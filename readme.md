# JavaScript Problem Solving

This repository contains various *JavaScript problem-solving examples* using functions.  
Each solution demonstrates different programming concepts and logic-building skills in JavaScript.

## Topics Covered

### *Convert*
- Converting between data types: String ↔ Number, Boolean ↔ Number.
- Temperature conversions (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit).
- Unit conversions (kilometers ↔ miles, grams ↔ kilograms).
- String formatting and case conversions (uppercase, lowercase, title case).

### *Calculator*
- Performing basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Handling multiple inputs with loops.
- Supporting both integer and decimal calculations.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).

### *Math Operations*
- Using built-in Math methods like Math.round(), Math.floor(), Math.ceil().
- Calculating powers (Math.pow()), square roots (Math.sqrt()), and absolute values (Math.abs()).
- Working with random numbers (Math.random()).

### *Min & Max*
- Finding the smallest and largest numbers in an array.
- Using both loops and built-in methods (Math.min() / Math.max()).
- Comparing numbers entered by the user.

### *Date*
- Using the Date() object to get the current date and time.
- Formatting date in different styles (YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY).
- Extracting specific parts: year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds.
- Calculating the difference between two dates.

### *Leap Year*
- Function to check if a given year is a leap year.
- Handling both positive and negative years.
- Using mathematical logic: divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless divisible by 400.

### *No Duplicate*
- Removing duplicate elements from an array.
- Using loops, Set, and filter() method.
- Case-insensitive duplicate removal for strings.

### *Odd*
- Checking if a number is odd.
- Extracting odd numbers from a given range or array.
- Using the modulus operator (%) to determine odd numbers.
- Applying odd number logic in real-world cases like filtering IDs or selecting alternate items.

### *Even*
- Checking if a number is even.
- Extracting even numbers from a given range or array.
- Using both modulus operator (%) and bitwise operations.

### *Average (Avg)*
- Calculating the average of numbers in an array.
- Handling both integer and decimal results.
- Avoiding division by zero for empty arrays.

### *Total*
- Getting the total sum of elements in a dataset.
- Summing prices in a shopping cart scenario.
- Supporting both positive and negative numbers.

### *Swap*
- Swapping values between two variables using:
  - Temporary variable
  - Destructuring assignment
  - Arithmetic operations (without a temporary variable)

### *Validation*
- Validating different types of user inputs:
  - Email format validation
  - Phone number format checking
  - Required field checks
- Using regular expressions (RegExp) for pattern matching.
